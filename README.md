This repository contains a Power BI project focused on analyzing and visualizing operational and business insights related to Blinkit, a leading quick commerce delivery platform. The purpose of this project is to extract meaningful patterns from data and present them in an interactive, easy-to-understand dashboard that supports strategic decision-making.

Project Overview
The project simulates a business intelligence solution by examining various aspects of Blinkit's service performance and customer behavior. The dataset, which represents real-world scenarios (with anonymized or sample data), was cleaned and transformed using Power Query before being analyzed and visualized in Power BI.

Key Features and Insights
Sales Analysis: Detailed breakdown of total sales, average order values, and sales trends over time, helping to identify high-performing periods and seasonal patterns.

Product Performance: Evaluation of best-selling products, least-performing items, and category-level analysis to understand customer preferences.

Customer Insights: Analysis of customer behavior, including order frequency, average purchase size, and loyalty patterns.

Geographical Trends: City-wise and region-wise analysis to assess demand, delivery efficiency, and logistical considerations across different locations.

Operational Metrics: Key performance indicators such as delivery times, order fulfillment rates, and service-level compliance.

Interactive Filters: Dynamic slicers and filters allowing users to explore the data from multiple perspectives, including time period, product category, and region.

Tools and Technologies Used
Power BI Desktop: For data visualization and dashboard creation

Power Query Editor: For data cleaning and transformation

DAX (Data Analysis Expressions): For creating calculated columns, measures, and advanced analytics

Excel/CSV files: Used as data sources (simulated Blinkit data)

Purpose
This project is designed to demonstrate my ability to work with business data, identify trends, and communicate insights effectively using Power BI. It is especially relevant for roles involving data analysis, business intelligence, and reporting. The dashboard can serve as a foundational model for further expansion with real-time data sources and API integration in a professional setting.
